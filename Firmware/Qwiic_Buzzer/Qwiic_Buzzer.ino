  Qwiic Buzzer is an I2C based buzzer that accepts commands to turn on/off the buzzer.
  It also can set it's frequency, duration and volume.

  There is also an accompanying Arduino Library located here:
  https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Buzzer_Arduino_Library

  To install support for ATtiny84 in Arduino IDE: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/master/Installation.md
  This core is installed from the Board Manager menu
  This core has built in support for I2C S/M and serial
  If you have Dave Mellis' ATtiny installed you may need to remove it from \Users\xx\AppData\Local\Arduino15\Packages

  To support 400kHz I2C communication reliably ATtiny84 needs to run at 8MHz. This requires user to
  click on 'Burn Bootloader' before code is loaded.

  Library Inclusion:
  Wire.h        Used for interfacing with the I2C hardware for responding to I2C events.
  EEPROM.h      Used for interfacing with the onboard EEPROM for storing and retrieving settings.
  nvm.h         Used for defining the storage locations in non-volatile memory (EEPROM) to store and retrieve settings from.
  registers.h   Used for defining a memoryMap object that serves as the register map for the device.
  buzzer.h      Used for configuring the behavior of the onboard BUZZER

  avr/sleep.h             Needed for sleep_mode which saves power on the ATTiny
  avr/power.hardware      Needed for powering down peripherals such as the ADC/TWI and Timers on the ATTiny
